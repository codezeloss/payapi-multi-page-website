![Design preview for the PayAPI multi-page website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The user should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
